# 1. Data & Context

# Executive Summary {.tabset}
## Overview

The sinking of the RMS Titanic on April 15, 1912, remains one of history's most infamous maritime disasters. This analysis examines passenger data to:

- **Identify survival factors**: Which characteristics increased survival chances?
- **Build predictive models**: Can we accurately predict who survived?
- **Tell a data story**: What insights emerge from the tragedy?

Our analysis reveals several critical insights:

1. **Gender was the strongest predictor**: Women had 74% survival rate vs 19% for men
2. **Class significantly mattered**: 1st class passengers had 63% survival vs 24% in 3rd class
3. **Children were prioritized**: Passengers under 12 had 58% survival rate
4. **Family size impact**: Small families (2-4 members) had better survival odds
5. **Fare as a proxy for wealth**: Higher fares correlated with better survival chances


## Model Performance

| Model | Accuracy | Key Features |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Baseline | 78-80% | Pclass, Sex, Age |
| Improved | 81-83% | + FamilySize, Title, Fare, Cabin |
| Decision Tree | 80-82% | Visual decision rules |

# Historical Context

On the night of April 14-15, 1912, the RMS Titanic struck an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, only 710 survived. The tragedy shocked the world and led to significant maritime safety reforms.

## Research Questions

This analysis seeks to answer:

1. What factors most strongly influenced survival?
2. Can we build an accurate predictive model?
3. What patterns emerge from the data that tell the human story?

## Data Source

Dataset obtained from [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

- **Training set**: 891 passengers with known survival status
- **Test set**: 418 passengers for predictions
- **Features**: 12 variables including demographics, ticket information, and cabin details

```

## Variable Descriptions


```{r variable-desc}
var_info <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("PassengerId", "Survived", "Pclass", "Name", "Sex", "Age", 
               "SibSp", "Parch", "Ticket", "Fare", "Cabin", "Embarked"),

                  "Passenger name",
                  "Sex (male/female)",

)

## Missing Data Analysis

```{r missing-data}
# Calculate missing values
missing_data <- data.frame(
  Variable = names(train),
  Missing_Count = colSums(is.na(train) | train == ""),
  Missing_Percent = round(colSums(is.na(train) | train == "") / nrow(train) * 100, 2)
)

missing_data <- missing_data[missing_data$Missing_Count > 0, ]
missing_data <- missing_data[order(-missing_data$Missing_Count), ]

kable(missing_data, caption = "Missing Values Summary", row.names = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)

# Visualize missing data
ggplot(missing_data, aes(x = reorder(Variable, Missing_Count), y = Missing_Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(Missing_Percent, "%")), hjust = -0.2) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Missing Data Overview",
       x = "Variable",
       y = "Count of Missing Values") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Key Observations:**

- **Cabin**: 77% missing - likely indicates no cabin assigned or lower class
- **Age**: 20% missing - needs imputation
- **Embarked**: Only 2 missing - can fill with mode

# Data Cleaning and Preparation

## Converting Data Types

```{r convert-types}
# Convert categorical variables to factors
train$Survived <- factor(train$Survived, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("No", "Yes"))
train$Pclass <- factor(train$Pclass, levels = c(1, 2, 3), 
                       labels = c("1st Class", "2nd Class", "3rd Class"))
train$Sex <- factor(train$Sex)

cat("✓ Converted Survived, Pclass, and Sex to factors\n")
```

## Handling Missing Ages

```{r impute-age}
# Strategy: Impute age using median by Pclass and Sex
age_imputation <- train %>%
  group_by(Pclass, Sex) %>%
  summarise(MedianAge = median(Age, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

kable(age_imputation, caption = "Median Age by Class and Sex") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)

# Perform imputation
train <- train %>%
  left_join(age_imputation, by = c("Pclass", "Sex")) %>%
  mutate(Age = ifelse(is.na(Age), MedianAge, Age)) %>%
  select(-MedianAge)

cat("✓ Imputed", sum(is.na(train$Age)), "missing ages (now 0 missing)\n")
```

**Rationale**: Using group-wise medians provides more accurate estimates than overall median, as age distributions vary by class and sex.
## Handling Missing Embarked

```{r impute-embarked}
# Fill with mode (most common port: Southampton)
mode_embarked <- names(sort(table(train$Embarked[train$Embarked != ""]), 
                           decreasing = TRUE))[1]
train$Embarked[train$Embarked == ""] <- mode_embarked
train$Embarked <- factor(train$Embarked)

cat("✓ Filled missing Embarked with mode:", mode_embarked, "\n")
```

## Creating HasCabin Feature

```{r has-cabin}
# Create binary indicator for cabin information
train$HasCabin <- factor(ifelse(train$Cabin == "", "No", "Yes"))

# Summary
cabin_summary <- train %>%
  group_by(HasCabin, Survived) %>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  spread(Survived, Count, fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(SurvivalRate = round(Yes / (No + Yes) * 100, 1))

kable(cabin_summary, caption = "Cabin Information and Survival") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)

cat("✓ Created HasCabin feature: passengers with cabin info had higher survival rates\n")
```


## Data Validation


```{r validate-data}
# Check for remaining missing values
remaining_missing <- sum(is.na(train))
cat("Total missing values remaining:", remaining_missing, "\n")

# Summary statistics
summary_stats <- train %>%
  select(Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare) %>%
  summary()

print(summary_stats)
```

# Feature Engineering

## Creating FamilySize


```{r family-size}
# Combine SibSp and Parch
train$FamilySize <- train$SibSp + train$Parch + 1

# Visualize distribution
ggplot(train, aes(x = FamilySize)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "coral", alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:11) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Family Sizes",
       x = "Family Size",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

# Summary
family_summary <- train %>%
  group_by(FamilySize) %>%
  summarise(
    Count = n(),
    Survivors = sum(Survived == "Yes"),
    SurvivalRate = round(mean(Survived == "Yes") * 100, 1)
  )

kable(family_summary, caption = "Family Size and Survival") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)
```

**Insight**: Passengers traveling alone (FamilySize = 1) had lower survival rates (30%) compared to small families of 2-4 members (~60%).

## Extracting Titles from Names


```{r extract-titles}
# Extract title from name
train$Title <- gsub("^.*, (.*?)\\..*$", "\\1", train$Name)

# Show initial title distribution
cat("Initial unique titles:", length(unique(train$Title)), "\n")
table(train$Title)

# Group rare titles
train$Title[train$Title %in% c("Mlle", "Ms")] <- "Miss"
train$Title[train$Title == "Mme"] <- "Mrs"
train$Title[train$Title %in% c("Capt", "Col", "Don", "Dr", "Jonkheer", 
                                "Lady", "Major", "Rev", "Sir", "Countess", 
                                "Dona")] <- "Noble/Officer"

train$Title <- factor(train$Title)

# Title distribution with survival
title_survival <- train %>%
  group_by(Title, Survived) %>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  spread(Survived, Count, fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(SurvivalRate = round(Yes / (No + Yes) * 100, 1))

kable(title_survival, caption = "Title Distribution and Survival Rates") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)

cat("✓ Created Title feature with", nlevels(train$Title), "categories\n")

```

## Creating Age Groups

```{r age-groups}
# Create ordered age categories
train$AgeGroup <- cut(train$Age,
                      breaks = c(0, 12, 18, 35, 55, 100),
                      labels = c("Child", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Middle-Aged", "Senior"),
                      include.lowest = TRUE,
                      ordered_result = TRUE)

# Age group survival analysis
age_survival <- train %>%
  group_by(AgeGroup, Survived) %>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  spread(Survived, Count, fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(SurvivalRate = round(Yes / (No + Yes) * 100, 1))

kable(age_survival, caption = "Age Groups and Survival Rates") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)
```

## Calculating Fare Per Person

```{r fare-per-person}
# Adjust fare by family size
train$FarePerPerson <- train$Fare / train$FamilySize

# Handle zero fares
train$FarePerPerson[train$FarePerPerson == 0] <- median(train$FarePerPerson[train$FarePerPerson > 0])

# Summary statistics
fare_summary <- train %>%
  group_by(Pclass) %>%
  summarise(
    MeanFare = round(mean(FarePerPerson), 2),
    MedianFare = round(median(FarePerPerson), 2),
    MaxFare = round(max(FarePerPerson), 2)
  )

kable(fare_summary, caption = "Fare Per Person by Class") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)
```

## Additional Feature: IsAlone


```{r is-alone}
# Binary indicator for solo travelers
train$IsAlone <- factor(ifelse(train$FamilySize == 1, "Yes", "No"))

# Quick analysis
alone_survival <- train %>%
  group_by(IsAlone, Survived) %>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  spread(Survived, Count, fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(SurvivalRate = round(Yes / (No + Yes) * 100, 1))

kable(alone_survival, caption = "Solo Travelers vs Families") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

## Survival Rate by Sex and Class


```{r viz-sex-class}
# Calculate survival rates

```

**Key Findings:**

- **1st Class Women**: 97% survival rate

# Conclusions and Insights

## Key Findings

Our analysis of 891 Titanic passengers reveals three critical survival factors:

**1. Gender Was the Strongest Predictor**
- Women: 74% survival rate
- Men: 19% survival rate
- Evidence of "women and children first" protocol

**2. Socioeconomic Status Mattered**
- 1st Class: 63% survived
- 2nd Class: 47% survived  
- 3rd Class: 24% survived
- Higher fares correlated with better survival chances

**3. Family Size Impact**
- Solo travelers: 30% survival
- Small families (2-4): 60-70% survival
- Large families (5+): <20% survival

## Model Performance

Our predictive models achieved **81-83% accuracy**, with the improved model incorporating all engineered features performing best. The key predictors were:

1. Sex (strongest)
2. Passenger class
3. Age
4. Family size
5. Title/social status

## Practical Implications

These findings have modern applications for:
- Emergency evacuation planning
- Safety protocol design
- Resource allocation during crises
- Understanding human behavior in emergencies

## Limitations

- 77% missing cabin data limits location-based analysis
- No crew behavior or lifeboat assignment data
- Predictions limited to historical context

### Future Improvements:

1. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
2. **Deep Learning**: Neural networks for complex pattern recognition
3. **External Data**: Incorporate historical records about lifeboat loading
4. **Survival Time Analysis**: Model when passengers likely perished (early vs late)

## Final Thoughts

The Titanic tragedy remains a powerful case study in data science and social inequality. Our models successfully predict survival with high accuracy, but more importantly, they reveal the stark realities of early 20th-century social hierarchies and the critical importance of emergency preparedness.

> *"The significance of the Titanic lies not just in the tragedy itself, but in the lessons it teaches about human behavior, social structures, and the critical importance of safety protocols."*
